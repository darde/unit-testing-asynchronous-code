## Unit testing asynchronous code

This is a small project developed to aim developers to understand how to test
asynchronous code with [Jest](https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fjestjs.io%2F) and [Testing-library/react](https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftesting-library.com%2Fdocs%2Freact-testing-library%2Fintro). Also this brings some
concepts of test doubles such as Mocks and Stubs.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts
