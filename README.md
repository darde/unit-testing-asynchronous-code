# Testing asynchronous code with Jest and Testing Library React

This is a small project developed to help developers to understand how to test
asynchronous code with [Jest](https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fjestjs.io%2F) and [Testing-library/react](https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftesting-library.com%2Fdocs%2Freact-testing-library%2Fintro). Also this brings some
concepts of test doubles such as Mocks and Stubs.

You can use this repo following my article on Medium [Testing asynchronous code with Jest and Testing Library React](https://medium.com/rd-shipit/testing-asynchronous-code-with-jest-and-testing-library-react-cfc185d7bd78).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
